> Author - Cameron Thacker (cthacker@udel.edu)

* This project includes C implementation of single linked list, double linked list, and triple linked list, the implemenations of the list use the function `malloc` and pointer arithmetic. The default name of the structure to contain the nodes of the linked list are `node`, and the functions available including removing, adding, and displaying the nodes.
